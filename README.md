# notification-service
GCloud hosted app engine notification service.  

This repo contains a submodule, so this is how you should clone it:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/OpenAgricultureFoundation/notification-service
```

If you didn't clone it that way, simply do:
```bash
cd notification-service 
git submodule update --init
```

When you want to update the submodule to its latest master branch:
```bash
git submodule update --remote
```
